This is a solution for a technical interview for a Junior/Trainee React developer position. The goal is to demonstrate the developer's knowledge of React, showing the use of concepts such as component creation, calls to an API, interaction with state, use of the useEffect and useState hooks and the creation of custom hooks, as well as the implementation of automated tests with Playwright.
